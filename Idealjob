 <h3> The Position? </h3>
        <p1> The position of being a senior software Engineer appeals to me as the role of designing, developing and installing software appears exciting. Jobs like this won’t make me bored as I like to do different things every day. As being in this position means I need to write and integrate APIs using C# and Web API, I will be open to a lot of challenges that will guide my knowledge into the right path. Web development in this role like to write code, drive improvements, manage pull requests and commits using Git is an aspect I have only just been open to which I find extremely fun to do. If being in this position means that I will be able to experience many aspects of software and engineering, then I am more than happy to set it as my goal.  </p1>

 <h3> The Skills, Qualifications and Experiance Required? </h3>
        <p1> To be accepted into this position, I will need to be able to work in the Philippines and I must be qualified with a bachelor’s degree in Information technology, Computer science, Engineering in computer or telecommunications or equivalent. This degree needs to be backed up with at least 5 years’ experience in both the fields that meet the needs of a Senior Software Engineer position and Supplementary qualifications experience in building API’s from scratch in an environment of complexity with preference to using (SOA) service-oriented architecture. Knowledge and experience in conducting testing and running transcripts, and agile methodology is required. Other requirements include skills in software development, demonstrating logical, creative and analytical thinking and owning written and verbal communication skills in English.  </p1>

 <h3> The Skills, Qualifications and Experiance I Have? </h3>
        <p1> The skills, qualifications and experience I currently have included written and verbal communication skills in both English and Arabic and Basic knowledge of writing code, managing pull requests and commits using Git. I have started a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT and hoping to graduate in the year 2021. Being an SRC (School representative council) member for 2 years in my high school I have gained strong skills in communication, team work, logical, analytical and creative thinking.  </p1>

 <h3> The Plan? </h3>
        <p1> In order to obtain these skills, I will follow a plan in which will allow me to reach my goals. I will approach the plan as follows. Completing my Bachelor of Information Technology to the best of my abilities while watching tutorials and guides in how to develop and code software. I will try my best to read as much as possible about the areas surrounding Engineers in all aspects. I will then try to apply for internship at companies across the range of computers and programming to gain the 5-year experience that would help me achieve qualifications and skills that will allow me to succeed in such positions. While all this will be going on, I hope to play around with code and experiment different areas so that I will have an idea about different languages. Code academy and khan academy will be a good source to gain some basic experience. </p1>
